# CIE302 - Banker's Algorithm

Multithreaded program that implements the bankerâ€™s algorithm - Programming project for chapter 7, Operating Systems Concepts textbook.

Several customers request and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant a request only if it leaves the system in a safe state. A request that leaves the system in an unsafe state will be denied. This project combines three separate topics: (1) multithreading (2) preventing race conditions (3) deadlock avoidance

This code is fully developed by Ahmed Wael and Mohamed Elsayed for the operating system class in spring 2018.


## Makefile:
The code can be compiled to produce output and cleaned to remove the output using make

```
$ make
gcc -pthread main.c -o main
$ ./main 2 3 4
$ make clean
rm -f main
```

## Error handling:
Code is capable of handling the input error cases.

```
$ ./main 2 3
usage: a.out <# of src 1> <# of src 2> <# of src 3>
$ ./main 2 4 -3
Argument -3 must be non-negative
```

## How to use
Determine the number of instances in each resource and let the program simulate kernel using banker algorithm.

```
$ ./main 100 100 100
